# Frontend Mentor Contact Form

## The [Contact form](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/contact-form--G-hYlqKJj) is a Free Challenge at [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home).

## The project:

This challenge is supposed to be a Junior challenge designed to test more mid-level JS skills. However, I wanted to flex my newly acquired React skills and as I had heard Forms in React can be tricky I thought this might be a good challenge.

## My process:

After reviewing the design files, I decided to use Flexbox as I often use Grid now and I don't want to settle into too much of a routine.

I initially thrashed out the HTML and JSX as I knew managing the state would be a challenge. This was actually straightforward in the end and the real challenge lay in validating the data I had and managing the render cycles/conditional rendering to ensure errors were displayed correctly. 

I worked from the top of the design document down at a mobile level then moved up to large screen sizes. This was great up until a gotcha which I'll detail below.

## Key learning:

I've learned a lot through this project. I've utilised the new React tech/patterns I've learned (controlled inputs, useRef()) and some new CSS (has() in particular) and have been very happy with the results. I'm very happy with how little Googling I had to do for this project. 

## Final thoughts and takeaways:

I did pretty well throughout this project however there was a gotcha that caught me out - the error messages were hard to integrate into the forms without disrupting the design and I not only had to re-write code I also had to change how I approached the margins and integrated the errors into the flow of the document. 

It wasnt the end of the world but it took a lot of time that could have been saved. Next time as I complete a section I'll review all states at different sizes and make sure the system I set myself up works in all states. Lesson learned for sure.
